### 🧠 OpenAI Agents SDK

The **OpenAI Agents SDK** is a lightweight and production-ready framework that enables you to build **agentic AI applications** with ease. It’s designed with minimal abstractions, yet powerful enough to express complex AI workflows using Python.

>✅ Production-ready upgrade of the experimental Swarm framework.

## ✨ Features

-**Agents**: LLMs equipped with instructions and toolsets.
-**Handoffs**: Agents can delegate tasks to other agents.
-**Guardrails**: Validate inputs and enforce constraints before proceeding.
-**Function Tools**: Any Python function becomes a callable tool with automatic schema and validation.
-**Tracing**: Visualize, debug, monitor, and fine-tune workflows with built-in tracing support.
-**Python-First**: No need to learn new paradigms—just use Python natively.

## 🚀 Why Use the Agents SDK?

-**✅ Fast to learn**: Minimal primitives, quick to integrate.
-**⚙️ Customizable**: Works great out of the box, but allows full control if needed.
-**🔁 Agent Loop**: Manages LLM-tool interactions, including multi-step reasoning loops.
-**🤝 Collaboration via Handoffs**: Delegate subtasks across multiple specialized agents.
-**🧪 Parallel Guardrails**: Validate and break early if input conditions are not met.

## 🔧 Core Concepts

### 🔹 Agents
Agents are AI models (LLMs) with specific instructions and tools to perform intelligent tasks.

### 🔸 Handoffs
Allow agents to delegate a subtask to another agent and then resume the workflow.

### 🛡️ Guardrails
Define input checks and constraints that must pass before executing the task.

### 🛠️ Tools
Turn any Python function into an intelligent tool using decorators and automatic validation via Pydantic.

### 📈 Tracing
Built-in tracing UI to debug, monitor, and optimize agent workflows with OpenAI’s evaluation and fine-tuning tools.
